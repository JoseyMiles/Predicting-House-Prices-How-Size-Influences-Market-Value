# Predicting-House-Prices-How-Size-Influences-Market-Value
This project uses a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Buenos Aires based on size. By cleaning and filtering the data, the model focuses on properties in "Capital Federal" and excludes outliers. The project evaluates the model's performance using mean absolute error (MAE) and visualizes the size-price relationship.
